# ReJx — the regex-teaching game!

## Intro

This is meant to be a puzzle game that people can learn regex skills (and then never use them, because regex is a bad, but fun, idea).

The goal is to provide a framework for different levels and stages, so if ya'll want to expand this, just fork it and pr it — you know, github stuff.

I am sorry for using npm: I'm no used to yarn or pnpm yet. You are welcome for using vite: it is great, isn't it?

## Local Setup Stuff

Clone it, do the good old `npm i` and the world will be your oyster.
